          Our Heartfelt Mission Statement. Seriously.
        </h2>
        <p>
          In 2003, a group of Indonesian explorers set sail in the North Pacific, searching for the fabled city of gold; El Dorado. What they found, however, was the stuff of nightmares.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were abruptly introduced to a grossly overexpanded population of squirrels: a problem they were certainly not expecting, and that they were entirely unprepared for. No one from that expedition lived to tell the tale.
        </p>
        <p>
          The one thing that expedition taught us was that we are powerless in an ever changing world if we are not both well-armed and proactive. That is why we have come together as a collective to save not only the human race, but the squirrel race itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a constantly expanding squirrel birthrate, at about 1200 squirrels a second, they have become a danger to themselves. Food is growing scarce, and territory scarcer. These squirrel populations have already evolved into a species with a test for the flesh of the innocent: namely, <strong>other squirrels</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is why we have opened up a group dedicated solely to the hunting of squirrels. We hope to bring the population back to controllable levels, in order to reverse the carnivorous genetic mutation. Together, we can ensure we are always prepared. Together, we can stop this from <strong><em>ever</em></strong> happening again.
